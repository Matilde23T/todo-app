# Todo App üìù

## Presentation 

Todo App is a full-stack application developed with Node.js and React.js.

The backend is a demo built with Node.js:
Data is managed in memory, without the use of a database.
Credentials are predefined for demonstration purposes.

The main goal is to demonstrate the integration between the frontend and backend, simulating typical operations of a full-stack application.

Main features:

- Login with demo credentials.
- Create new todos.
- Categorize todos to improve organization and the user experience.

This project is intended as a practical exercise to test state management, HTTP requests, and communication between the frontend and backend in a real-world context.

## External libraries

- Lucide react (icons)
- Lottie files (gif icon)

## Hosting and deployment

- Render (backend)
- Netlify (frontend)
